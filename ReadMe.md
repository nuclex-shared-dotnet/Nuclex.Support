Nuclex.Support
==============

This library aims to be your trusty toolbox of supporting code for
problems that come up in any type of project. It consists of carefully
chosen and well-designed pieces that aid you in dealing with settings
storage, change notifications, stream processing, object cloning and more.

There are unit tests for the whole library, so everything is verifiably
working on all platforms tested (Linux, Windows, Raspberry).
